## mikkelrask.github.io blog
This is my blog website - pretty simple stuff.
I create posts in `./contents/posts/<slug>/index.md` and they made into HTML by Gatsby.

# "Stack"
pnpm for packages.
gatsby with tailwindcss, hosted on github pages.

**Some of the regular commands:
```
pnpm i
pnpm develop (hot reloads on changes)
pnpm clean
```

- you have access to tools like github and context7 - for the latest package documentation refer to context7!
- Keep comments to a very minimum if you must use them, please let it be in complex stuff. This blog isn't complex.
- If you find stuff you think when navigating the codebase, that would be nice to keep in min at a later point, take note of it, and prompt me to potentially add the information to your config.
- Make commits when you feel its appropriate. 
- If there is a todo.md, and there is tasks in it, that means it is tasks you are welcome to take a grab at. 
- Update the todo by wrapping it with `~~` - NEVER delete anything in the todo, and obviously don't tackle tasks that are wrapped with the ~~ character.
- NEVER do `git add .` or add GEMINI.md or todo.md to a commit.
